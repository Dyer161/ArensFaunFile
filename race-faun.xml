		<description>
			<p> Cow ears and tails, horns and legs like a goat separate Fauns from humans; as well as their predisposition. These Fey-ancestry humanoids are light-hearted and prone to taking it easy. They range in height from the shortest at 3.5 feet to the tallest at just over 6, with most at about 5.5, and they run the gamut of hair colors and styles. They are native to everywhere from steep mountain ranges to deep forests to wide-open plains and have adapted to their surroundings over long periods of time. They breed often and stay fertile most of their lives, having litters of 2-8 kids every decade or so. A Faun would be most contented working as a craftsman or researcher or farmer, though their innate nimbleness makes them fantastic hunters and fighters. Half-Faun children can be born with any, or none, of their faun parent's traits, but their aptitude for creativity generally shines through.</p>
			<h4>FAUN TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your Faun character has the following traits in common with all other Fauns.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Age. </i></b>Fauns mature at about the same rate as humans, or a little slower. They can generally expect to live up to 150-200 years. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Alignment. </i></b>Most are generally kind and gracious in nature, making them tend to be good, and do not usually stray towards either lawfulness or chaos. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Size. </i></b>Fauns vary well in build, some being stocky and wide, others being willowy and thin. Generally, your height will be around 5 and a half feet. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Speed. </i></b>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Darkvision. </i></b>You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Languages. </i></b>You can speak, read and write Common and Sylvan. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Subrace. </i></b>Fauns differ depending on the environment they grew up in or were born into. The types of faun are Forest, Mountain, Plains, and City. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Fey Ancestry. </i></b>You have advantage against saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Trance. </i></b>Fauns sleep very lightly compared to other races, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Artisan Tools. </i></b>Fauns are naturally drawn to creating and crafting. You gain proficiency with one set of artisan tools of your choice. </p>

			<p>As a Forest Faun, you have a deep understanding of the great woods and their denizens both plant and animal. Your hind legs may appear more deer-like than goat-like, and your hair is likely to be brownish, with or without white spots. Bows and slings feel right in your hands and hunting comes naturally. </p>

      <p>More mountain goat than domesticated goat, these Fauns are at home on the uneven and extremely steep terrain of mountains. These Fauns tend to be deeper thinkers and scholars, preferring botany over bushcraft and animal husbandry over hunting. They still consider themselves close to nature, but they see it in an academic approach. Most of the aristocracy of this subrace will be a remnant from the old kingdoms. </p>

      <p>These Fauns are more rural than their city-dwelling counterparts, preferring an agrarian lifestyle in villages or small towns farming and living off the land. Faun villages are typically communal-living arrangements of up to several hundred Fauns in houses that will contain up to 30 families each. A central living area with both sleeping and private chambers are surrounded by animal pens and fields in a radial arrangement to the other buildings. These Fauns are more antelope-like than the others, being able to jump great heights and run very fast to catch their prey and avoid becoming it. </p>
